# Diffuse Shader: Hardwired simple shader in silicon

A simple shader as used in rendering applications in silicon.
This [shader](https://github.com/gonsolo/pepe) was written in
[Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel), compiled to
Verilog, and for simplicity included and instanced in the original
user_proj_example.v file.
